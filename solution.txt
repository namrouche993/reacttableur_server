Like medieval castles, API defenses are done in layers:


-  Secure transport layer by using only HTTPS, and you can do it for free with LetsEncrypt.

-  Add security headers, check them with a tool, and enable a report uri on them to know in real-time the violations happening in the browser.

-  JWT encrypted tokens(JWE) by preference or at least signed tokens(JWS).

-  Obfuscate your Javascript with at least an open source tools, e.g javascript-obfuscator.

-  Sign the request with an HMAC and use the Web Cryptography API to help you with that.

-  Use reCAPTCHA V3 from Google or similar tool from other vendor. This type of recaptcha doesn't require user interaction.

-  Web Application Firewall(WAF) in front of your API server.

-  User Behavior Analytics(UBA), that will use Artificial Intelligence(AI) try to tell apart the who from the what.
